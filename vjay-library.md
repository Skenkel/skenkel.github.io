There is a process to curate "loops" and other sources. 

What makes a good loop? 
It's fast. It has movement that can sync to the beat. 
It's recognizable thematically. 
It's dynamic. 


How to make a loop:
Acquire source footage. 

There a two good types of footage, one is full anime, tv etc. The other is to use AMVs. 
Open up the footage in davinci resolve and use cut/scene detection to split your source footage to individual shots. 
 
Export those shots from davinci, use resolume alley to convert your loops to a format for resolume.
