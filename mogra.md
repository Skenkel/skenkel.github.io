What is Mogra

Mogra is a club in tokyo wich does anime raves. Rather than an "anime aesthetic" to edm music, mogra does anisong (anime openings and endings) with visuals as a dj set.  
There are two types of songs for mogra, one is a song that has video attached (an anime opening, an amv), the other is a traditional VJay setup where virtual dj handles music, and resolume handles video. 

Mogra at home workflow 1

As a side project, I'm working on mogra at home. 

Anisongs:
1080p Anime openings and endings. Youtube-dl is the best option I've found so far. Still looking for better. 
.MP4 allows for mixedinkey to be used. 
I can also use AMVs. 

Library curation:
This is the hard part. Mixed in key will annotate songs. Picard will detect correct artist and song title, but not the source anime. 



Core Hardware:
Dj Controller. 4 channel allows for ai stems mixing.
I'm still learning to mix. Beatmatching, phrase matching, choosing where and how to mix from song to song is fun, and I certainly need more practice.  
I swear by virtual dj (serato's windows video handling is garbage), and use a numark ns4fx controller usually.
