As a side project, I'm working on mogra at home. 

Acquire Anisong:
1080p Anime openings and endings. Youtube-dl is one option. Still looking for better. 
.MP4 allows for mixedinkey to be used. 

Library curation:
Currently unsolved. Organizing via genre or artist isn't enough. 

Hardware:
Dj Controller.  2 channel works.
4 channel allows for stems mixing. 

Full VJ upgrade
Video Controller.  to buy apc mpc40 mk2
Capture care for resolume. To buy elgato camlink. 

More sound:
Currently have 1 monoprice srd215. a second would allow for more volume, and true stereo.
