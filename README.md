Who was I?

I used to travel the earth building news and sports stations. Then I started doing sre work and got a masters in machine learning. 


Who am I?

These days I focus on technology and art. 
I have a day job, (involving reliability, distributed systems and using ml for practical things), but that's not really what this is about. 

I've always been a weeb, and that is a defining component of my aesthetic, so most of my aesthetic interest is in exploring that subculture, or the intersection of that subculture with sword fighting, dungeons and dragons and similar. 
I've always been interested in the  bleeding edge of technology and aesthetics, at least until recently.

What happened to the old site?

It didn't reflect who I was anymore. I'm no longer a ccna. I haven't done ACSR work in a very long time. 
If you want to check wayback machine you can see what it was. 

What's next?

Gans and Generative Text models (now called llms) went from experiments during my masters, to very very popular. However, none of them solve the larger socio-economic issues with modern art.

Those two issues being:

1. Who wants to experience the art that I am creating (where's the audience)?

2. How much should it cost?


For now, I'm focused on live experiences (music and visuals), also because in the world of 2024, people want to have experiences in physical space. 
The experience being the product gives me basic answers to 1 and 2. The audience is whoever is present live (either in person or on a stream). It needs to cost whatever it costs to keeps the lights on at the facility you are using to perform. 


Current Projects

I am a firm believer you shouldn't automate/involve technology into an art practice before you've learned the "traditional" ways to make thart art, even if it's just so you understand the aesthetic traditions you are rejecting.

So currently I'm learning to DJ, VJay and AMVJay.  
For the VJay part, I'm going through the course at https://vidvox.github.io/vvedu/ and a course by dadageek, focusing on resolume.  
For DJ practice I'm learning, and I'm investigating a mogra [mogra at home](https://drunkenthieves.com/mogra) setup, as well as a more generic [vjay library](https://drunkenthieves.com/vjay-library), with virtualdj being my primary stack. 

Future Projects

[strudel](https://strudel.cc/workshop/getting-started/) is fascinating, as is the mandolin. 
I own some hardware synths, as well as ableton, and right now I'm exploring the dungeon synth genre as a listener.  Eventually it mighy be fun to dive into DnD/Larp style live music.
