Who was I?

I used to travel the earth building news and sports stations. Then I tried to learn machine learning, and starting doing SRE work. 


Who am I?

These days I focus on AI art. 
I have a day job, (involving reliability and distributed systems), but that's not really what this is about. 
I've always been a weeb, and frankly I find I like using the most advanced techniques I can find for creative purposes, rather that explicitly productive purposes. 


What happened to the old site?

It didn't reflect who I was anymore. I'm no longer a ccna. I haven't done ACSR work in a very long time. 
If you want to check wayback machine you can see what it was. 

What's next?


I'm not sure. 

My project bandwidth is low in 2021 (trying to finish my masters), and I'm waiting for the "state of art" in arxiv to catch up to "usable, reproducible, and understandable enough" for something larger. 


Future Projects

Trying to teach chatbots to play werewolf against each other might be fun. 

being the "producer" for an AI band (4 different agents collaborating with each other, with a human being able to join) would be cool.

Trying to Automate Anime Music Videos (so I can watching infinite amvs forever). 

when the tech is better, I'd like to take another pass at training an AI to write RPG adventures.
